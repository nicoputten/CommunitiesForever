# In-game verification

Claude Code cannot run WoW. Every unverified API and every story's manual test lives here. Nico runs them and records results.
This file holds only open items. Answered API questions move to `docs/API-FINDINGS.md`; passed story steps are removed.

## Open API questions
| # | Question | How to test | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| V8 | Is `clubId` identical across clients? (design does not depend on it) | `/fp clubs` on two clients | open |
| V30 | Is the left-to-right tree order the classic one for other classes too? (CF-18; verified for Warrior) | On a non-Warrior character with talents: `/cf self` shows `talents: <tree> N / <tree> N / <tree> N`. Check that the points sit under the right tree names (e.g. a Holy Paladin has its points under Holy). | open |
| V35 | Which events tell what you did in dungeons and battlegrounds? (CF-23; login and zone events are logged already) | `/fp feed` (stays on after `/reload`), then: enter a dungeon, kill at least one boss, leave; queue and finish a battleground; play part of it in a group. `/fp feed off` and send the `FEED` lines: `ENCOUNTER_END`/`BOSS_KILL` args per boss, `instance ... type` (party/raid/pvp), the group members with GUIDs, and the battleground status and winner. | open |
| V39 | How does an addon add a channel to a chat window now that `ChatFrame_AddChannel` is gone? (CF-25 Community tab) | Copy the updated `tools/FriendProbe`, `/reload`. 1) `/fp chat find`: send the log (functions with "Channel" in their name). 2) `/fp chat tab` and click the button: does the `FP Community` tab now show community messages? Send the `channels now in window` line. Close the test tab afterwards. | open |


## Manual test steps per story
(Added by Claude Code as stories are completed. Format: story ID, steps, expected result, status.)

### CF-17 Alts outside the community (round 3)
Round 2 passed. One fix left:

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|

### CF-20 Relay
Needs three Battle.net accounts on this build (A, B, C): relaying always involves three different BattleTags. A is Battle.net friends with both; B and C do not need to be friends with each other. All have a character in the community. Can wait until a third person is available.

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A and B online together for ~10 s, then B logs off. Later C logs on while A is online (B stays offline) | Within ~10 s C sees B's community characters under B (not in Unlinked), and B's card says `Updated <time> via <A's name>`. | open |
| B and C not Battle.net friends at all | Same as above: B is shown under his name through A (trust is the community). | open |
| Later B and C are online together (if they are friends) | The `via` line disappears: B's own record replaced the relayed copy. | open |
| B changes something (level up) while A is online and C is offline; then C logs on while B is offline | C gets B's new level through A. | open |
| `/reload` on C | B's relayed data stays. | open |

### CF-15 Login notifications
Needs a friend linked to you in the community (they do not need the addon).

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|

Found a bug  that a friend logged off  and it shows that the account is offline but character is still online? even after 5min
### CF-16 Level-up announcements
Needs a friend running this build, linked to you in the community.

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Friend levels up while you are both online | Within ~10 s: `Sjaak's <character> reached level N` in your chat. | open |
| A friend's level-up older than 15 minutes (e.g. arriving through relay later) | No line. | open |
| `/cf settings` → untick "Announce friends' level-ups", friend levels up | No line. | open |
