# In-game verification

Claude Code cannot run WoW. Every unverified API and every story's manual test lives here. Nico runs them and records results.
This file holds only open items. Answered API questions move to `docs/API-FINDINGS.md`; passed story steps are removed.

## Open API questions
| # | Question | How to test | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| V8 | Is `clubId` identical across clients? (design does not depend on it) | `/fp clubs` on two clients | open |
| V30 | Is the left-to-right tree order the classic one for other classes too? (CF-18; verified for Warrior) | On a non-Warrior character with talents: `/cf self` shows `talents: <tree> N / <tree> N / <tree> N`. Check that the points sit under the right tree names (e.g. a Holy Paladin has its points under Holy). | open |
| V35 | Which events tell what you did in dungeons and battlegrounds? (CF-23 is built on the Mainline signatures; this checks them) | `/cf activity debug` (stays on after `/reload`; `/fp feed` logs the same events), then in a group with a community member: enter a dungeon, kill a boss, leave after 10 min; queue and finish a battleground. Send the `[activity]` lines. Check: `instance:` inside shows `<name>, party` (raid, pvp); `ENCOUNTER_END` passes `encounterID, name, difficulty, groupSize, 1` on a kill (`BOSS_KILL` too?); `group:` counts the other players and the community companion; at the battleground end `PVP_MATCH_COMPLETE` passes the winner (0 Horde / 1 Alliance) and `battleground ended:` says `won true` when your side won. Last line: `left ...: recorded`. | open |
| V41 | Does a closed chat tab keep its name, with `shown` and `docked` off? (CF-26 feedback: Create did nothing after closing the Community tab) | Close the Community tab (right-click the tab, Close Window), then `/dump GetChatWindowInfo(<n>)` with `n` the tab's number (6 if it was the first new tab). Expected: the name is still there, the 7th value (`shown`) is false/nil and the 9th (`docked`) nil. Then Create in `/cf setup` (Community chat step) or `/cf settings` makes the tab again. | open |

## Manual test steps per story
(Added by Claude Code as stories are completed. Format: story ID, steps, expected result, status.)

### CF-26 Onboarding wizard (round 2)
Round 1 passed. Two changes from the feedback:

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Close the Community tab, then `/cf setup` → Community chat | The big Create button is back; clicking it creates the tab again (see V41). | open |
| Log in on an alt in the community without a Community tab (or `/run CommunitiesForeverDB.global.settings.chatTabPrompt = nil` and `/reload`) | The prompt has one big "Yes, create a Community tab" button. Clicking it creates the tab; closing the window (X) means no. Either way the alt is not asked again after the next login. | open |

### CF-23 Dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and playing together
Needs a friend running this build in the same community. `/cf activity debug` on shows why something is or is not recorded (V35). `/cf debugon` shows sample lines (a raid, battlegrounds and a shared dungeon line) without playing.

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/cf debugon`, Activity tab | "Show all" on Debug Friend's line lists Debug Alt with `raided Molten Core (4 bosses)` and `2 battlegrounds (1 won)` first; a line `<you> and Debug Friend together` with `ran Blackfathom Deeps ×2` (the `×` shows, not a box). `/cf debugoff`. | open |
| Enter a dungeon, `/cf activity` | `In <dungeon> (party) for 0 min, 0 bosses killed.` | open |
| Alone: kill a boss, leave after 10+ min | Your Activity line today starts with `ran <dungeon>`. | open |
| Leave a dungeon before 10 min, or without a boss kill | No line for it (debug: `not recorded, ...`). | open |
| `/reload` inside a dungeon, then kill a boss and leave after 10+ min | Recorded: the run survived the reload. | open |
| With the friend in one group: run a dungeon, kill a boss, leave after 10+ min | Both clients (after ~1 min sync): one line `<you> and <friend> together` with `ran <dungeon>`, and the run is not on your own lines. | open |
| With a community member who does not run the addon and is not your Battle.net friend | `ran <dungeon> with <their character name>` on your line. | open |
| Finish a battleground (stay until the end) | `1 battleground (won)` or `(lost)`, matching the result. Leaving early: no line. | open |

### CF-17 Alts outside the community (round 3)
Round 2 passed. One fix left:

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|

### CF-20 Relay
Needs three Battle.net accounts on this build (A, B, C): relaying always involves three different BattleTags. A is Battle.net friends with both; B and C do not need to be friends with each other. All have a character in the community. Can wait until a third person is available.

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A and B online together for ~10 s, then B logs off. Later C logs on while A is online (B stays offline) | Within ~10 s C sees B's community characters under B (not in Unlinked), and B's card says `Updated <time> via <A's name>`. | open |
| B and C not Battle.net friends at all | Same as above: B is shown under his name through A (trust is the community). | open |
| Later B and C are online together (if they are friends) | The `via` line disappears: B's own record replaced the relayed copy. | open |
| B changes something (level up) while A is online and C is offline; then C logs on while B is offline | C gets B's new level through A. | open |
| `/reload` on C | B's relayed data stays. | open |

### CF-15 Login notifications
Needs a friend linked to you in the community (they do not need the addon).

| Step | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|

Found a bug  that a friend logged off  and it shows that the account is offline but character is still online? even after 5min
