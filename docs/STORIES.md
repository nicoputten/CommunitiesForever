# Backlog

Open stories only, in build order. Done stories move to `docs/STORIES-COMPLETED.md`.
Each story: criteria are testable. "Manual" items go into VERIFY.md.

Build order: CF-02 (part 2: tag workflow, needs the `CF_API_TOKEN` secret).

## E0 Foundation

### CF-02 Release pipeline
- Pushing a git tag `v*` runs the BigWigs packager and uploads to CurseForge (Forever flavor) using the `CF_API_TOKEN` secret. CurseForge project ID in the TOC (`## X-Curse-Project-ID`).
- Still open (part 2, once the `CF_API_TOKEN` secret exists): the tag workflow itself.
- Untagged pushes produce no release.
- Done in part 1 (PR #21, merged without the token): project ID 1752013 in the TOC, zip with forward-slash paths, campfire logo in `docs/logo/`, and the released files contain no personal info. Author `Vestras` (TOC and LICENSE), generic examples in `src` comments, hand-written `CHANGELOG.md` (`manual-changelog` in `.pkgmeta`) instead of a changelog built from commit messages. `tests/spec/Release_spec.lua` fails on banned names in the released files. The repo stays private; its history is unchanged.
- Manual: install via the CurseForge app; publishing a new tag delivers an update.
- The package contains only the addon: `.pkgmeta` ignores tests, tools, docs, `VERIFY.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and the CI config. Check: unzip the built package and list its files.
